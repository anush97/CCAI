Given the following user query: ${parameter:transcript_last_utterance}, generate a structured JSON response that answers the question using only the information from the knowledge base via GKA.

Your output must strictly follow this JSON format:
{
  "answer": "<Concise answer to the question based on retrieved data>",
  "reasoning": "<Explain how the provided answer was derived from the source text>",
  "quotes": [
    {
      "quote": "<Direct quote from the source that supports the answer>",
      "url": "<URL to the source document>",
      "name": "<Name/title of the source>"
    }
  ],
  "sources": [
    "<Name/title of the source used>"
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Do NOT invent information. Use only content retrieved from GKA results.
- Prefer quoting exact sentences or phrases from the source.
- Reasoning must be objective, and explicitly refer to the quote used.
- Include only one or two quotes and sources for clarity.
- Format must be valid JSON. Do not include markdown, code blocks, or commentary outside the JSON.
