TASK: Using the agentâ€™s most recent message, query the connected Generative Knowledge Assist (GKA) knowledge base and return the response in the following strict JSON format:

{
  "answer": "<short and precise answer text>",
  "reasoning": "<step-by-step neutral explanation derived from the snippet(s) showing why the answer is valid>",
  "quotes": [
    {
      "quote": "<verbatim passage from the GKA snippet>",
      "url": "<original source URL>",
      "name": "<title of the source>"
    }
  ],
  "sources": [1]
}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ${parameter:transcript_last_utterance} as the question.
- Always extract GKA snippets, and validate the final answer using them.
- The answer must come directly from the GKA snippet(s) and be clearly verifiable.
- If no snippet is found or answer is not clearly supported, return:
  {
    "answer": "I DO NOT KNOW",
    "reasoning": "I DO NOT KNOW",
    "quotes": [],
    "sources": []
  }
- Return **only the JSON**, no extra commentary or markdown.
